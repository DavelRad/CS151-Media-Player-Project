Nowadays, multimedia consumption has been an integral part of a lot of peopleâ€™s lives. However, there are a lot of media players that might be too complex for some and lacks certain tools for advanced users.

* Creating the basic outline of the media player using JavaFX, FXML, and Scene Builder.
* Building a bar that houses media file, play, pause, playback speed, skip, fullscreen buttons, volume slider, and video progress slider.
* Designing the outline with user-centric JavaFX GUI features and styling.
* Implementing the functionality of the buttons in Java.
* Including support for a wide range of media formats, such as MP3, MP4, AVI, and more. 
* Adding support for subtitles using SubRip which extracts subtitles and their timings to a .srt file.
* Using Java to read the .srt file and display the subtitles during their timing windows
* Providing a few essential keyboard shortcuts for convenience.
* Media library organization and playlist management features.
